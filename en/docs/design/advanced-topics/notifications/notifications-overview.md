# Notifications

The Notification System for WSO2 API Manager addresses a critical deficiency within the platform by introducing a mechanism to inform API Publishers and Developers about crucial changes to their APIs or subscriptions. This system aims to enhance communication, transparency, and responsiveness within the API management processes by providing timely alerts and updates regarding significant events such as workflow rejections, subscription blockings, and API-related updates.

## Notifications in the Publisher Portal:

When a publisher user has new notifications, the bell icon on the header will display the number of unread notifications. These notifications include events such as workflow approvals or rejections and API-related updates.

### Manage Notifications

1. **Mark Notifications as Read:** 

    After reading a notification, you can click on the "Mark as Read" icon associated with each notification. This action visually grayed out the notification, indicating that it has been read. The unread count displayed with the bell icon will update automatically.
