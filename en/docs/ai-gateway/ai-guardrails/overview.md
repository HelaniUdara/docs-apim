# AI Guardrails

Generative AI brings immense potential—but without the right controls, it also introduces significant risks.

LLMs (Large Language Models) are fundamentally **non-deterministic**. A request may succeed technically (returning a `200 OK`), but semantically **fail** your application’s logic, output expectations, safety guidelines, or compliance mandates. This disconnect creates a growing need for **real-time enforcement** of AI behavior.

### ❗ What Can Go Wrong: Risks of AI API Integration

| Problem | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧠 **Unpredictable Outputs** | LLMs may generate factually incorrect, incoherent, or harmful content—even when inputs seem safe. |
| ⚖️ **Bias and Fairness** | AI systems can amplify biases from training data, leading to discriminatory or offensive results. |
| 🕵️ **Security Vulnerabilities** | Attacks like **prompt injection** can subvert your prompts and redirect model behavior maliciously. |
| 🔐 **Privacy Leaks** | Generated outputs can expose sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) unintentionally. |
| 📜 **Regulatory Risk** | Lack of content moderation or auditability can breach compliance frameworks such as GDPR, HIPAA, or internal ethical standards. |

As adoption of LLMs and AI services accelerates across sectors, it’s critical for organizations to move beyond experimentation and toward **safe, reliable production usage**. This requires governing AI systems a through a **structured behavioral control framework** that ensure:

- **AI outputs remain aligned** with organizational values, policies, and formatting standards.  
- **Requests are inspected and validated** before reaching the model to prevent abuse or misuse.  
- **Responses are evaluated and refined** to uphold quality, safety, and compliance.  
- **Systems can respond intelligently**—through retries, fallbacks, or logging—when model behavior deviates from expected norms.

These practices help establish **trustworthy AI integrations**, minimize unexpected failures, and enable organizations to confidently scale their AI workloads in production.

## 🛡 Safeguard AI API Integrations with **WSO2 AI Guardrails**

AI Guardrails in WSO2 AI Gateway are **real-time validation and enforcement layers** that sit between your application and the underlying AI provider.

They act as intelligent filters that:

- Inspect both **inputs** and **outputs** to AI models.
- Apply **policy-driven checks** to assess safety, quality, and compliance.
- Enable client applications to implement **adaptive response strategies** based on given guardrail error responses.
